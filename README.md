## Abstract

Five years ago we started a project (<https://coli-conc.gbv.de>) to facilitate
creation and management of concordances between knowledge organization systems
such as controlled vocabularies, classification schemes, and thesauri. Since
then we have collected thousands of mappings, made them available with its
diverse vocabularies, and developed the web application Cocoda to easily create
and evaluate mappings (<https://github.com/gbv/cocoda>). The talk will less
focus on the outcome of this project: the data is freely made available via Web
APIs, the data formats are documented, and the software is open source both by
license and by development process. Instead we will tell the paths that have
been taken (we had to throw away two working prototypes), explain technical
decisions that have been made (we developed a new data format to express more
than SKOS in JSON), and show existing challenges (it can be hard to motivate
librarians to try out new tools).
