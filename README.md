## Abstract

The project coli-conc(<https://coli-conc.gbv.de>) aims to facilitate creation,
easy management, and storage of concordances between knowledge organization
systems such as controlled vocabularies, classification schemes, and thesauri
on a single platform. Since its foundation five years ago we have collected
numerous mappings between diverse indexing systems and vocabularies from
various sources and projects in different subject fields. The mappings are
freely made available in a uniform format for use and exchange by libraries and
other institutions. The second contribution of coli-conc is the web application
Cocoda to enhance the speed and efficiency of the intellectual mapping building
process as well as to evaluate existing and newly created mappings
(<https://github.com/gbv/cocoda>). 

The talk will less focus on the outcome of project: mapping data is available
via Web APIs, the data formats are documented, and the software is open source
both by license and by development process. Instead we will tell the paths that
have been taken (we had to throw away two working prototypes), explain
technical decisions that have been made (development of a new data format to
express more than SKOS in JSON), and show existing challenges (it can be hard
to motivate librarians to try out new tools).
